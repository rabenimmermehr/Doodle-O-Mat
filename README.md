A script, that opens up a given doodle(www.dooodle.com) - link and selects the workdays of the next weeks, adds timeslots and saves everything


1. Setup
-----------

o Clone the repository into your workspace
o Install maven from here http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
  - Follow the instructions further down

o Open Eclipse, import the project ("import existing project")
o Install m2Eclipse frome here http://www.eclipse.org/m2e/download/
o Right-click project, select "configure->convert to maven project"
  - Ignore the error

Now you are ready

happen in the code
